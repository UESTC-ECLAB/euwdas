================================
Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
================================

Implementation of heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms
for solving and approximating the TSP problem.

Categories of algorithms which are implemented:
- Greedy
- Simulated Annealing (SA)
- Threshold Accepting (TA)
- Tabu Search
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

Travelling Salesman Problem tries to find, given the weight
(distance) between all points where salesman has to visit, the
route so that:
- Total distance (cost) which salesman travels to be minimized.
- Salesman has to return to the point where he stated.
- Salesman has to visit each point only once apart fom source
point.

It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization,
important in operations research and theoretical computer science.

def greedy_tsp(G, source, weight='weight'):
    """Finds the route that salesman hat to visit in order
    to minimize total distance and total distance using a
    simple greedy algorithm.

    In essence, function returns a cycle given a source point
    which total cost of cycle is minimized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G: A complete weighted graph.

    source : node
        Starting node

    weight: string, optional (default='weight')
        Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If graph is not either complete or weighed,
        algorithm raises an exception.

    Returns
    -------
    sol : list, cost : float
        Returns the route (list of edges) that salesman
        has to follow to minimize total cost, and total
        cost of algorithm's solution.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G.add_weighted_edges_from({('A', 'B', 3),
    >>>                           ('A', 'C', 17), ('A', 'D', 14), ('B', 'A', 3),
    >>>                           ('B', 'C', 12), ('B', 'D', 16), ('C', 'A', 13),
    >>>                           ('C', 'B', 12), ('C', 'D', 4), ('D', 'A', 14),
    >>>                           ('D', 'B', 15), ('D', 'C', 2)})
    >>> sol = nx.greedy_tsp(G, 'D')
    >>> print(sol[0)
    [('D', 'C'), ('C', 'B'), ('B', 'A')]
    >>> print(sol[1])
    17.0

    Notes
    -----
    Implementation of greedy algorithm is based on the following:
    - Algorithm adds a couple of nodes to the solution at every
    iteration.
    - Algorithm selects the couple of nodes which adds the minimum
    cost to incomplete solution at every iteration.

    A greedy algorithm does not give always the best solution.
    However, it can construct a first feasible solution which can
    be passed as parameter in iterative improvement algorithm such
    as Simulated Annealing, Threshold Accepting.
